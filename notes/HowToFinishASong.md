# How To Finish A Song

- STEP 1: Preparation
  - Have all parts by other people (vocals, guitar…) ready and perfectly recorded.
  - Make sure you have everything you need to get started (DAW, plugins, samples, autoload, routing, NO DISTRACTIONS etc.)
- STEP 2: Songwriting
  - Start with a chord progression
  - Write a catchy vocal melody or main instrument melody (this will break or make your song)
  - Added melodies, counter melodies, arpeggiators...
  - Add sustained elements: pads, atmospheres, subtle background melos or noises.
- STEP 3: Sound Design
  - Find fitting presets & samples
  - Tweak these sounds to your liking
  - Layer sounds
  - Consider distortion
  - Apply the first creative EQing
  - Add your rough reverb and delay
  - Get creative & take your time
- STEP 4: Arrangement
  - Create a clear structure:
  - Pop Songs: Verse / Pre-Chorus / Chorus / Verse / Pre-Chorus / Chorus / Bridge / Chorus
  - Club Songs: Intro / Build Up / Drop / Build Up / Drop / Outro
  - Create transitions
  - Add FX
  - Crate automations
  - Make sure the song has an arc of tension (last chorus full and epic)
  - Add earcandy (this is essential to make sure song sound "finished")
  - Do not repeat to much this gets boring really fast
- STEP 5: Mixing
  - Start with a rough mix (increasing / decreasing volumes of every track)
  - Now go through every single track, listen to it in solo & in the mix + consider all of the following things:
  - Adding a high-pass filter (almost every time)
  - EQing (shaping the sound to sound better in the mix)
  - Compression (usually less than you think)
    - always on vocals and self recorded track, but not on samples necessarily etc.
    - Panning and widening (iZotope’s Imager is a great free plugin for this)
  - Saturation and distortion (use with moderation)
  - Fine tune your Reverbs & Delays (EQ them as well)
  - Mid/side EQing only if really needed
  - Dynamics EQs good for resonating/disturbing frequencies
  - Check again for clicks, breaths and noises they might be louder due to compression.
- STEP 6: Referencing
  - Listen to your own song a couple times and write down everything that doesn’t work and needs to be fixed.
  - Repeat the same with producer friends (that know what they’re talking about)
    - Try what they suggest, but at the end it’s your call, you are the producer.
  - Test on other systems and compare your song to professional productions
- STEP 7: Mastering
  - If it’s a commercial release, let someone else master it. For a rough demo to play in the club or send it as a demo you can master it yourself.
  - EQ
  - Compression
  - Limiting (at least -14 LUFS, don’t go too loud to avoid distortion)
  - DON’T OVERDO IT!!!
  - If the master changes the sound by more than 5% you should probably go back to mixing
  - Don’t know how to master? Try izotope Ozone the presets are good starting points.
